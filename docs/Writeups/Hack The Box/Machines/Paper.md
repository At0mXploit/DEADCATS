Both port seem to redirect to same page `80` and `443`.

We see `office.paper` add it to hosts file.

Searching for the vulnerabilities related to WordPress version 5.2.3, I found a vulnerability that allows [**unauthenticated View Private/Draft Posts**](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/3413b879-785f-4c9f-aa8a-5a4a1d5e0ba2).

From POC above, Go to `http://office.paper/?static=1`:

![](/img/htb-machines/paper3.png)

Add `chat.office.paper` to hostfile.
## `chat.office.paper`

![](/img/htb-machines/paper4.png)

Register and login.

This is what the message says:

```
Hello. I am Recyclops. A bot assigned by Dwight. I will have my revenge on earthlings, but before that, I have to help my Cool friend Dwight to respond to the annoying questions asked by his co-workers, so that he may use his valuable time to... well, not interact with his co-workers.
Most frequently asked questions include:
- What time is it?
- What new files are in your sales directory?
- Why did the salesman crossed the road?
- What's the content of file x in your sales directory? etc.
Please note that I am a beta version and I still have some bugs to be fixed.
How to use me ? :
1. Small Talk:
You can ask me how dwight's weekend was, or did he watched the game last night etc.
eg: 'recyclops how was your weekend?' or 'recyclops did you watched the game last night?' or 'recyclops what kind of bear is the best?
2. Joke:
You can ask me Why the salesman crossed the road.
eg: 'recyclops why did the salesman crossed the road?'
<=====The following two features are for those boneheads, who still don't know how to use scp. I'm Looking at you Kevin.=====>
For security reasons, the access is limited to the Sales folder.
3. Files:
eg: 'recyclops get me the file test.txt', or 'recyclops could you send me the file src/test.php' or just 'recyclops file test.txt'
4. List:
You can ask me to list the files
5. Time:
You can ask me to what the time is
eg: 'recyclops what time is it?' or just 'recyclops time'
```

![](/img/htb-machines/paper6.png)

Tried to message the bot.
## Command Injection

`list sale`

![](/img/htb-machines/paper7.png)

We see `dwight` it must be in this directory so tried command injection.

`list ../../dwight`

![](/img/htb-machines/paper8.png)

I saw `user.txt` and folder called `hubot`.

`list ../../dwight/hubot`

![](/img/htb-machines/paper9.png)

We see `.env` file view it:

`file ../../dwight/hubot/.env`

![](/img/htb-machines/paper10.png)

We get creds `recyclops:Queenofblad3s!23`. Try to SSH to `recyclops` wont work because that user may not exist so try with `dwight` username.

```bash
$ ssh dwight@office.paper

## Privilege Escalation Path

Using LINPeas tells us we have pretty popular vulnerability `Polkit-exploit CVE-2021–3560`.
## [CVE-2021-3560](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Almorabea/Polkit-exploit/refs/heads/main/CVE-2021-3560.py)

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
