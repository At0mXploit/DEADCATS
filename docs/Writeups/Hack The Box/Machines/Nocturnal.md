- After Loggin in to site there seems to be `File Upload`.
- `Invalid file type. pdf, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, odt are allowed.`
- Tried uploading files by changing extension but didnt worked.
# Exploitation

- When I uploaded a `.odt` or other available file in my files section it showed this endpoint.

![](/img/htb-machines/endpoint.png)

- Further look into the web reveal endpoint when downloading the file `/view.php?username=test1&file=sample.pdf`. The `username` parameter will be use as a point to enumerate user that available in this web application.

```

- If I now go to `http://nocturnal.htb/view.php?username=amanda&file=test.pdf` we will get available file for download which is `privacy.odt`.
- P.S Tried for other `admin` and `tobias` but they had nothing.
- If we try to see file using `Libre Office`, We get this:

```
Dear Amanda,

Nocturnal has set the following temporary password for you: arHkG7HAI68X8s1J. This password has been set for all our services, so it is essential that you change it on your first login to ensure the security of your account and our infrastructure.

The file has been created and provided by Nocturnal's IT team. If you have any questions or need additional assistance during the password change process, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Remember that maintaining the security of your credentials is paramount to protecting your information and that of the company. We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

  

Yours sincerely,

Nocturnal's IT team
```

- We got password for amanda `arHkG7HAI68X8s1J`.
- Now Login to Site ( For just curiosity tried this creds in SSH also but didnt worked).
- Amanda seems to have access to `Admin` Panel.

![](/img/htb-machines/noc.png)

- There is an option to enter backup password maybe we could do command injection there.
- If we try normal `pass;ls`  these simple payload it gives `Error: Try another password.`
- Good thing is we can view `admin.php` by just clicking in it.

```php
function cleanEntry($entry) {
    $blacklist_chars = [';', '&', '|', '$', ' ', '`', '{', '}', '&&'];

    foreach ($blacklist_chars as $char) {
        if (strpos($entry, $char) !== false) {
            return false; // Malicious input detected
        }
    }

    return htmlspecialchars($entry, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
}
```

- But this can be easily bypass with `\r\n` where this will be the point to split the command to execute another one and `\t` as substitute to space that has been blacklists.
- GPT Thank You.

- You can replace `/` with `\n`

- Sometimes it may not work so at that time just send request 4-5 times.

![](/img/htb-machines/red.png)

- Upon enumerating i found folder `nocturnal_databases`

![](/img/htb-machines/burppp.png)

- Most interesting file is `nocturnal_database.db` inside that folder. It might have hashes or password, username of user.
- Insert a real `TAB` between  and the file path (not 4 spaces) because it also has space filter or you can also use `%09`.
- Again saying if command doesn't work one time sending it atleast 4-5 times IDK if its bug or what.
- Tried using `cat` but it doesnt give anything it shows:

```
<pre></pre>
```

- Asked GPT it said to use `base64` to dump it.

![](/img/htb-machines/idk.png)

- Copied the base64 whole text and putted in `db.b64 base64 -d db.b64 > nocturnal.db` Used this to decode it to normal `.db` format.

```bash
~/target ❯ sqlite3 nocturnal.db

```

- Nice now we got hash Lets go to [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/), If it doesnt find then maybe we can use hashcat.
- Nice we got password of  `tobias` which is `slowmotionapocalypse` , `kavi` which is `kavi` and `p4rson` which is `parrot`
- Now we can `SSH` into them.

## Privilege Escalation Path

- Okay so we cant run `sudo -l` lets check which ports are open.

```bash

tobias@nocturnal:~$ 
```

- Port `8080` as open so we can do port forwarding like on [[Planning]]. (Tried port `80` but it was just `nocturnal.htb` site)

```bash
~/target ❯ ssh -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8080 tobias@10.10.11.64

tobias@10.10.11.64's password: 
```

- First here is `8000` our target port which we want site to load on main target, second port `8080` is of target which we want to port forward.
- Now visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
- Asked GPT it said:

- **Default username:** `admin` (always created during ISPConfig install)
    
- **Password:** You are required to **set your own password** during installation.
    
    - There is **no fixed default password** like `admin` or `1234` unless you installed from an unofficial auto-install script that sets one for you.

 - So we can use username as `admin` and password as from which we logged into tobias SSH `slowmotionapocalypse`.

![](/img/htb-machines/ispconfig.png)

- Version is `3.2.10p1` searched this `ispconfig 3.2.10p1 exploit github`.
- Got [this](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/issues/8804)
- `CVE-2023-46818` This was the CVE. Got [this](https://github.com/blindma1den/CVE-2023-46818-Exploit) POC.
