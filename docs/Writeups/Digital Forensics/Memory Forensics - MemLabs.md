# Memory Forensics

**Digital forensics** is the broad field that involves identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence from electronic devices (e.g., computers, phones, networks) while **Memory forensics** is the process of analyzing a computer's **volatile memory (RAM)** / Primary Memory (**Volatile memory** is a type of computer memory that loses all stored data when the power is turned off. ) to uncover evidence of malicious activity, such as malware, data breaches, or system intrusions.

An application is like during a cybercrime raid, investigators capture the suspect’s laptop without powering it down. A memory dump is taken and analyzed using **Volatility**. In RAM, they uncover a fileless trojan running in a legitimate process, hidden from the disk. They recover unencrypted chat logs, session tokens, and private keys for a crypto wallet. None of this data existed on the hard drive it all lived in memory. This crucial evidence links the suspect to a **real-time data theft operation**.

This page documents a set of **MemLabs** investigations, adapted into a research-note format. [MemLabs](https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs) is an educational series designed to introduce students and practitioners to **memory forensics** through guided scenarios. In several labs the workflow recovers multiple artifacts that need to be combined into a final secret string. More information and the original datasets are available in the project [repository](https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs).
# Volatility Installation

**Volatility** is a powerful **open-source memory forensics tool** used to analyze RAM dumps and extract digital evidence from volatile memory. Since MemLabs challenges are old, it is best to use `Volatility2.6` with it. Since volatility 2 have more plugins that are not yet to import to volatility 3 so we will have no choice but to use volatility 2.

To install it in Linux:

```bash
~/MemLabs ❯ wget https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/releases/download/2.6.1/volatility_2.6_lin64_standalone.zip
```

```bash
❯ unzip volatility_2.6_lin64_standalone.zip  
```

```bash
~/MemLabs/volatility ❯ ls
AUTHORS.txt  LEGAL.txt    README.txt
CREDITS.txt  LICENSE.txt  volatility_2.6_lin64_standalone

~/MemLabs/volatility ❯ sudo mv volatility_2.6_lin64_standalone  /usr/bin/volatility

~/MemLabs/volatility ❯ volatility -h 
<SNIP>
```

We will also need plugin, clone this [repo](https://github.com/superponible/volatility-plugins)

```bash
~/MemLabs ❯ git clone https://github.com/superponible/volatility-plugins
```

Now if we run:

```bash
~/MemLabs ❯ volatility --plugins=volatility-plugins --help
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6
*** Failed to import volatility.plugins.chromehistory (ImportError: No module named csv)
*** Failed to import volatility.plugins.firefoxhistory (ImportError: No module named csv)
```

We will see this error, to fix it you need to modify `chromehistory.py` and `firefoxhistory.py`. In `chromehistory.py`:

```python
# <SNIP>
import volatility.plugins.common as common
import volatility.scan as scan
import volatility.utils as utils
import volatility.addrspace as addrspace
import volatility.debug as debug
import volatility.obj as obj
import binascii
import sqlite_help
#import csv - Comment this out
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
#from Crypto.Protocol.KDF import PBKDF2 - Comment this out
# <SNIP>
```

In `firefoxhistory.py`:

```python
# <SNIP>
import volatility.plugins.common as common
import volatility.scan as scan
import volatility.utils as utils
import volatility.addrspace as addrspace
import volatility.debug as debug
import volatility.obj as obj
import binascii
import sqlite_help
#import csv - Comment this out
from datetime import datetime
# <SNIP>
```

Now everything will work normally.
# MemLabs Lab 0 - Never Too Late Mister
## **Challenge Description**

My friend John is an "environmental" activist and a humanitarian. He hated the ideology of Thanos from the Avengers: Infinity War. He sucks at programming. He used too many variables while writing any program. One day, John gave me a memory dump and asked me to find out what he was doing while he took the dump. Can you figure it out for me?

Challenge file: [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MjMGRiPzweCOdikO3DTaVfbdBK5kyynT/view)

This is a sample scenario and yields a single target artifact.
## Solution

We will need to always look at description because Forensics is vast field and we will most of times going to another direction or rabbit hole. We can see the word `environmental` is quoted which could mean something about environment variables.

```bash
❯ tar -xJvf Challenge.tar.xz

Challenge.raw
```

First thing we do with dump is that we can find out which operating system was dump taken on, for that we can use `imageinfo` plugin.

> Output of Volatility may take some time.

```bash
❯ volatility -f Challenge.raw imageinfo

```

We got different profiles which means OS but it has detected multiple services of `Windows 7`, we can use any but if we get error with it later we can switch another profiles.

Now we can use `--profile` flag to analyze with the profile we got and `pslist` plugin to see all process lists.

```bash
❯ volatility -f Challenge.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 pslist
```

![lab_0_1.png](/img/lab_0_1.png)

We got many processes lists, `DumpIt.exe` is service that might seems out of place but it is just service ran when dumping all this from RAM to Memory file. `conhost.exe` is used to run console application in Windows, We can see `cmd.exe` is being run which is suspicious. If John has `cmd.exe` he also must have ran some commands.

We can look at CMD history using plugin `cmdscan`.

```bash
❯ volatility -f Challenge.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 cmdscan

```

This may seem overwhelming at first but its simple. We see two process that was ran `cmd.exe` and `DumpIt.exe`. We see one commands in CMD which is 

```cmd
Cmd #0 @ 0x2f43c0: C:\Python27\python.exe C:\Users\hello\Desktop\demon.py.txt
```

Its running Python script. We can use plugin `consoles` to check its Output and Input.

```

We get interesting text `335d366f5d6031767631707f`, this also might be hash or hex value using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) or from terminal. Upon using CyberChef it didn't identify it has any hash.

```bash
❯ echo 335d366f5d6031767631707f | xxd -r -p

3]6o]`1vv1p
```

It's ASCII format also doesn't make sense, So we will leave it behind for later or it just might be. In description we saw quote of word `environment` which could mean something about environment variables. **Environment variables** are key-value pairs used by the operating system and programs to store configuration settings and system information.We can see it using `envars` plugin. Every process when starts, it starts with some environment variables. Output is very long.

```bash
❯ volatility -f Challenge.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 envars
<SNIP>
    2424 conhost.exe          0x002934b0 Thanos                         xor and password
<SNIP>
```

It shows Thanos environment variable as `xor and password` which could possibly be hint for the value we had above `335d366f5d6031767631707f`, We can again to go CyberChef and XOR it to get some value. Since we dont have key we can do XOR Brute-Force with that Hex decoded value `3]6o]'1vv1p`.

![lab_0_2.png](/img/lab_0_2.png)

As we can see we recovered only a partial secret, `1_4m_b3tt3r}`. We still need the missing segment. The hint also referenced `password`, so the next step is to inspect stored credential material with the `hashdump` plugin.

We know that password hashes (not the plaintext passwords) are stored in the **SAM (Security Account Manager)** file on disk:

```cmd
C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM
```

But it is stored in SSD/HDD, `So how does it dump?` It dumps from the `cache` which is stored in RAM.

```bash
❯ volatility -f Challenge.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 hashdump

```

We have to Hashes, Now we can crack it using John The Ripper but I prefer [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) because its wordlist is of 15GB while `rockyou.txt` is of some MBs. 

![lab_0_3.png](/img/lab_0_3.png)

Crackstation cannot crack it so its unlikely to be cracked using other tools.

But, This is actually a issue in Challenge which we can look at this [closed issues](https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs/issues/2), where author has said this:

```
Yes, I am also not sure why this issue is coming up. Actually, this challenge that I made is 2 years old and I used [https://md5decrypt.net/en/Ntlm/](https://md5decrypt.net/en/Ntlm/)for cracking the hash but it seems they have **refreshed** their database and this hash is no longer present.

That is the reason that I used Lab-0 as a sample challenge by providing the walkthrough.
```

So its uncrackable and we an take this hash `101da33f44e92c27835e64322d72e8b7` as our win.

We can find which plugin does what in Volatility, Read this [Command Reference](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/command-reference)
# MemLabs Lab 1 - Beginner's Luck
## **Challenge description**

My sister's computer crashed. We were very fortunate to recover this memory dump. Your job is get all her important files from the system. From what we remember, we suddenly saw a black window pop up with some thing being executed. When the crash happened, she was trying to draw something. Thats all we remember from the time of crash.

**Note**: This scenario is composed of three recoverable artifacts.

**Challenge file**: [MemLabs_Lab1](https://mega.nz/#!6l4BhKIb!l8ATZoliB_ULlvlkESwkPiXAETJEF7p91Gf9CWuQI70)

The commpressed archive

- MD5 hash: `919a0ded944c427b7f4e5c26a6790e8d`

The memory dump

- MD5 hash: `b9fec1a443907d870cb32b048bda9380`
## Solution

```bash
❯ 7z x lab_1.7z
```

We should always check Integrity of file.

```bash
❯ md5sum MemoryDump_Lab1.raw
b9fec1a443907d870cb32b048bda9380  MemoryDump_Lab1.raw
```

It matches the description hash so it's correct file.

```

From what we remember, we suddenly saw a black window pop up with some thing being executed. When the crash happened, she was trying to draw something. Thats all we remember from the time of crash.
```

This is big hint for us, we know that black window popup is mostly CMD and draw something means she was using MS-Paint or Photoshop or other software.

Only these are interesting processes. We can now use `cmdscan` to see history.

`ZmxhZ3t0aDFzXzFzX3RoM18xc3Rfc3Q0ZzMhIX0=` seems like `base64` so decode it.

```bash
❯ echo ZmxhZ3t0aDFzXzFzX3RoM18xc3Rfc3Q0ZzMhIX0= | base64 -d
`[redacted output]`
```

We got first Flag.

Now we can look at process `mspaint.exe` which PID is `2424`, We can dump its process memory using volatility. We can dump what was running in MS-Paint and then see that image in other software. We can dump memory using `memdump` plugin.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 memdump -p 2424 -D .

Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6
************************************************************************
Writing mspaint.exe [  2424] to 2424.dmp
```

`-p` flag for its Process ID and `-D` for destination.

```bash
❯ ls             
2424.dmp  MemoryDump_Lab1.raw
```

We got `2424.dmp` we need to view it using GIMP or other Photo Editing Software. We have dumped whole memory of MS-Paint, it will have everything other than images also like position of cursor, navabar, etc... which are junk data. We will need to find our image content in all that junk. If we try viewing `.dmp` in GIMP it wont be able to open because it can't process `.dmp` file, If we want to give raw data and is in unorganized manner we have to rename it to `.data` extension.

```bash
❯ mv 2424.dmp 2424.data  
❯ gimp 2424.data 
```

After running gimp we see our junk data, We need to make put specific offset, width, height such that the content is readable. It will take hours to do fr. Its basically a hit and trial method.

![lab_1_1.png](/img/lab_1_1.png)

After trying and scrolling down we got text that's upside down at:

- `Offset`: `0`
- `Width`: `3280`
- `Height`: `1000`

If we open it and flip it vertically we recover the second segment: `[redacted output]`.

For the final segment, `Winrar.exe` stands out as an interesting process. We know there are two types of interface: **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** and **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. Every GUI is essentially running CLI in backend. We can use `cmdline` plugin to see what arguments were supplied to that process.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 cmdline
<SNIP>
************************************************************************
WinRAR.exe pid:   1512
Command line : "C:\Program Files\WinRAR\WinRAR.exe" "C:\Users\Alissa Simpson\Documents\Important.rar"
************************************************************************
<SNIP>
```

Now we want `Important.rar`, We can use `filescan` plugin to see all files stored in RAM or Cache. We can specify it using `grep` because whole scan will be very long.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 filescan | grep -i important.rar

Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6

0x000000003fb48bc0      1      0 R--r-- \Device\HarddiskVolume2\Users\Alissa Simpson\Documents\Important.rar
```

The file appears three times because multiple file objects referencing the same path exist in memory, possibly due to multiple opens or remnants of past accesses. Each entry represents a different memory structure pointing to the same file like shortcuts or other things.

We now have address `0x000000003fa3ebc0` of file. If we want to dump address memory we can use `dumpfiles` plugin with flag `-Q` for address and `-D` for destination.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 dumpfiles -Q 0x000000003fa3ebc0 -D .

`Password is NTLM hash(in uppercase) of Alissa account passwd.` We can get using `hashdump` plugin like in Lab 0.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 hashdump

Put this Alissa hash `f4ff64c8baac57d22f22edc681055ba6` in Uppercase which is `F4FF64C8BAAC57D22F22EDC681055BA6`.

# MemLabs Lab 2 - Beginner's Luck
## **Challenge description**

One of the clients of our company, lost the access to his system due to an unknown error. He is supposedly a very popular "environmental" activist. As a part of the investigation, he told us that his go to applications are browsers, his password managers etc. We hope that you can dig into this memory dump and find his important stuff and give it back to us.

**Note**: This scenario is composed of three recoverable artifacts.

**Challenge file**: [MemLabs_Lab2](https://mega.nz/#!ChoDHaja!1XvuQd49c7-7kgJvPXIEAst-NXi8L3ggwienE1uoZTk)

The commpressed archive

- MD5 hash: `75d2ee1fcf2bc8a25329723e6ce2be93`

The memory dump

- MD5 hash: `ddb337936a75153822baed718851716b`
## Solution

There are some important hints in description itself like `Environmental` refers to environment variables and browsers and password managers.

We can now look for processes.

<SNIP>
```

These above are only interesting processes. We can first look at arguments passed in applications such as KeePass through `cmdline`.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab2.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 cmdline
<SNIP>
************************************************************************
KeePass.exe pid:   3008
Command line : "C:\Program Files (x86)\KeePass Password Safe 2\KeePass.exe" "C:\Users\SmartNet\Secrets\Hidden.kdbx"
************************************************************************
<SNIP>
```

We can dump the file using `filescan` first to find its location in memory.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab2.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 filescan | grep -i Hidden.kdbx
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6

```

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab2.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 dumpfiles -Q 0x000000003fb112a0 -D .
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6

❯ ls
file.None.0xfffffa8001593ba0.dat  MemoryDump_Lab2.raw
```

```bash
❯ mv file.None.0xfffffa8001593ba0.dat hidden.kdbx
```

Next we can use `keepass2` to open it but it will ask us for password or master key and we don't have it.

```bash
❯ keepass2 hidden.kdbx
```

We can use environment variables hint to find something interesting now. It will be really long but we can find this interesting `base64` encoded text.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab2.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 envars      
<SNIP>
    2012 dwm.exe              0x00000000003c1320 NEW_TMP                        C:\Windows\ZmxhZ3t3M2xjMG0zX1QwXyRUNGczXyFfT2ZfTDRCXzJ9

```

```bash
❯ echo ZmxhZ3t3M2xjMG0zX1QwXyRUNGczXyFfT2ZfTDRCXzJ9 | base64 -d
`[redacted output]`
```

We recovered the first token as `[redacted output]`. But it doesn't have any connection with our password. We can now leave this environment variables now let's focus on password. We can check `clipboard` where usually copied text are stored in RAM.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab2.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 clipboard

```

We got nothing useful, Next we can `filescan` for files starting with password word.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab2.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 filescan | grep -i password

```

Everything seems non useful or from KeePass internal program except for `\Device\HarddiskVolume2\Users\Alissa Simpson\Pictures\Password.png`. Let's dump it and see it's contents.

```bash
 ❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab2.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 dumpfiles -Q 0x000000003fce1c70 -D .

❯ mv file.None.0xfffffa8000d06e10.dat lab_2_1.png 
```

![lab_2_1.png](/img/lab_2_1.png)

There is password written in small which is `P4SSw0rd_123`. Now lets open keepass and enter this password.

```bash
❯ keepass2 hidden.kdbx   
```

![lab_2_2.png](/img/lab_2_2.png)

If we copy this recovered password from the Recycle Bin, we can recover the final output `[redacted output]`.

Lastly we need to check the browser hint. We need to inspect activity around `chrome.exe`. We can dump Chrome history using the downloaded plugin. The result includes many links, but only one is relevant to the protected archive.

```bash
 ❯ /usr/bin/volatility --plugins=../volatility-plugins -f MemoryDump_Lab2.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 chromehistory

```

We got one interesting link `https://mega.nz/#F!TrgSQQTS!H0ZrUzF0B-ZKNM3y9E76lg`, If we go there and download `Important.zip`.

```bash
❯ unzip Important.zip                    
Archive:  Important.zip
Password is SHA1(stage-3-FLAG) from Lab-1. Password is in lowercase.
   skipping: Important.png           unsupported compression method 99

❯ file Important.zip      
Important.zip: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compression method=AES Encrypted
```

It is password protected and includes the hint `Password is SHA1(stage-3-FLAG) from Lab-1. Password is in lowercase`. The third recovered value from Lab 1 was `[redacted output]`. Convert it to SHA-1.

```bash
❯ echo -n `[redacted output]` | sha1sum 
6045dd90029719a039fd2d2ebcca718439dd100a  -
```

Our password is `6045dd90029719a039fd2d2ebcca718439dd100a`

Since `unzip` doesn't support AES encryption we can use `7z`.

```bash
❯ 7z x Important.zip  

Enter password (will not be echoed): 6045dd90029719a039fd2d2ebcca718439dd100a
Everything is Ok

Size:       59291
Compressed: 57457

❯ ls
hidden.kdbx    Important.zip  MemoryDump_Lab2.raw
Important.png  
```

We can see we got `Important.png`, which contains the recovered secret.

`[redacted output]`
# MemLabs Lab 3 - The Evil's Den

## **Challenge Description**

A malicious script encrypted a very secret piece of information I had on my system. Can you recover the information for me please?

**Note-1**: This scenario yields one secret split into two parts.

**Note-2**: You'll need the first recovered segment to get the second.

You will need this additional tool to solve the challenge,

```shell
$ sudo apt install steghide
```

The output format for this lab is: `[redacted output]`

Only interesting process running is notepad. Maybe notepad was used to write script. We can use `notepad` plugin to view what was written but it only supports really old systems.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab3.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 notepad
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6
ERROR   : volatility.debug    : This command does not support the profile Win7SP1x86_23418
```

We can use `cmdline` plugins.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab3.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 cmdline
<SNIP>

```

The malicious script was `evilscript.py`. Let's download both files and see its code and contents but first we need their locations.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab3.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 filescan | grep -i "evilscript.py\|vip.txt"

```

> `/|` is used match either two or more patterns in grep.

We can use `dumpfiles` plugin to dump multiple files at once.

```bash

❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab3.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 dumpfiles -Q 0x000000003de1b5f0,0x000000003e727e50 -D .

❯ ls
file.None.0x83e52420.dat  file.None.0xbc2b6af0.dat  MemoryDump_Lab3.raw
```

We can use `file` command to know which is which and change its name.

```bash
❯ file file.None.0x83e52420.dat 
file.None.0x83e52420.dat: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators

❯ file file.None.0xbc2b6af0.dat 
file.None.0xbc2b6af0.dat: Python script, ASCII text executable, with CRLF line terminators

❯ mv file.None.0x83e52420.dat vip.txt            

❯ mv file.None.0xbc2b6af0.dat evilscript.py
```

```bash
❯ cat vip.txt                 
am1gd2V4M20wXGs3b2U=

❯ echo am1gd2V4M20wXGs3b2U= | base64 -d
jm`wex3m0\k7oe%
```

Its still gibberish maybe its encrypted, lets look at `evilscript.py`

```python
import sys
import string

def xor(s):

	a = ''.join(chr(ord(i)^3) for i in s)
	return a


def encoder(x):
	
	return x.encode("base64")


if __name__ == "__main__":

	f = open("C:\\Users\\hello\\Desktop\\vip.txt", "w")

	arr = sys.argv[1]

	arr = encoder(xor(arr))

	f.write(arr)

	f.close()
```

Its simple program that open `vip.txt` and XOR's it and then converts that XORed to Base64. We can write code to decrypt it.

```python
import sys
import string
import base64

def xor(s):

	a = ''.join(chr(ord(i)^3) for i in s)
	return a


def decoder(x):
	
	return (base64.b64decode(x)).decode()


if __name__ == "__main__":

	f = open("vip.txt", "r")

	arr = f.read()

	arr = xor(decoder(arr))

	print(arr)

	f.close()
```

```bash
❯ python3 decode.py
`[redacted output]`
```

We got the first recovered segment, `[redacted output]`, and from the description we know it is needed to recover the second one. It also mentioned `steghide`, which only supports `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.bmp`, so we can search for one of those files with the `filescan` plugin and inspect it for hidden data.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab3.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 filescan | grep -i "jpg\|jpeg\|bmp"
```

We will get very long list of files but we need to find one with name that stands out.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab3.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 filescan | grep -i "jpg\|jpeg\|bmp"

<SNIP>
0x0000000004f34148      2      0 RW---- \Device\HarddiskVolume2\Users\hello\Desktop\suspision1.jpeg
<SNIP>
```

We find obviously suspicious file with name `suspision1.jpeg`, first dump it like previously.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab3.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 dumpfiles -Q 0x0000000004f34148 -D .
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6

❯ ls

evilscript.py  MemoryDump_Lab3.raw

❯ mv file.None.0x843fcf38.dat suspision1.jpeg
```

**Steganography** is the practice of hiding secret information within an ordinary file (like an image, audio, or video) so that the presence of the information is concealed. Unlike encryption, it hides the _existence_ of the message rather than just scrambling its contents. We can use `steghide` now to see hidden contents under that image.

```bash
❯ steghide extract -sf suspision1.jpeg 
Enter passphrase: `[redacted output]`
wrote extracted data to "secret text".
```

We used previous half output as password and got `secret text` file.

```bash
❯ cat 'secret text' 
_1s_n0t_3n0ugh}
```

We now have full output as `[redacted output]`
# MemLabs Lab 4 - Obsession
## **Challenge Description**

My system was recently compromised. The Hacker stole a lot of information but he also deleted a very important file of mine. I have no idea on how to recover it. The only evidence we have, at this point of time is this memory dump. Please help me.

**Note**: This scenario yields a single recovered secret.

The output format for this lab is: `[redacted output]`

**Challenge file**: [MemLabs_Lab4](https://mega.nz/#!Tx41jC5K!ifdu9DUair0sHncj5QWImJovfxixcAY-gt72mCXmYrE)
## Solution

This scenario centers on recovering a deleted file. Up to this point we were mostly extracting artifacts already resident in RAM or cache, but here the investigation shifts toward file recovery from memory structures. The final secret is stored in that recovered file.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab4.raw imageinfo

Only interesting find is `StikyNot.exe`. Tried using `cmdline` to find arguments but got nothing. Since StikyNot also helps in copy we can use `clipboard` plugins also but there was also nothing. We can use `screenshot` plugin to see screenshot but it won't be clear it will mostly be blank or show outlines of desktop.

```bash

This doesn't seem to give anything useful except for `eminem` username in `C:/Users` . We can try hit and trial method to enumerate something useful from Users Folder.

```bash

Hm, Weird thing is that when we try to dump only two files got dumped in `.dat` other one file didn't got dumped - this happens when file is deleted and that is the file which we are after and want to recover. First we gotta find out which file is missing:

```bash
❯ file file.None.0xfffffa80022ad0f0.dat
file.None.0xfffffa80022ad0f0.dat: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, aspect ratio, density 1x1, segment length 16, baseline, precision 8, 1500x844, components 3

❯ file file.None.0xfffffa80022d1670.dat
file.None.0xfffffa80022d1670.dat: PNG image data, 1366 x 334, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
```

So both `.jpeg` and `.png` file are here and missing one is `important.txt` which is deleted and we want to recover.

**Cache** is a small, high-speed memory located close to the CPU that stores frequently accessed data and instructions. Its main purpose is to reduce the time it takes for the processor to access data from the main memory (RAM), which is comparatively slower. By keeping copies of the most-used information close to the processor, cache minimizes latency and allows the CPU to perform tasks more efficiently without waiting for slower memory access. 

L1, L2, and L3 cache are levels of memory that speed up processing by storing frequently accessed data closer to the CPU. L1 is the fastest and smallest, directly on the processor core. L2 is larger and slightly slower, also on the core or a separate chip. L3 is the largest and slowest of the three, often shared between cores, and sits on the CPU.

1) **L1 Cache:**
    
     The smallest and fastest cache, often divided into instruction (L1i) and data (L1d) caches for each processor core. It's typically measured in kilobytes (KB). 
    
2) **L2 Cache:**
    
     Larger than L1, it can be on-chip or on a separate chip with a high-speed bus to the CPU. It's also measured in kilobytes (KB) or megabytes (MB). 
    
3) **L3 Cache:**
    
    The largest and slowest of the three, but still faster than RAM. It's often shared between multiple CPU cores and can be measured in megabytes (MB).

How they work together:

When the CPU needs data, it first looks in the L1 cache. If not found, it searches L2, then L3. If still not found, it accesses the main memory (RAM), which is slower. Data found in higher levels of cache is copied to lower levels to speed up future access.

**MFT (Master File Table)** is a critical component of the NTFS (New Technology File System) used by Windows. It acts like a database that stores information about every file and directory on an NTFS volume. 

When a file is deleted in a computer system, it isn't immediately erased from the storage drive. Instead, the operating system simply removes the pointer or reference to that file in the file system's index (like removing a name from a table of contents), and marks the space the file occupied as available for reuse. For example, if `Secret.docx` is deleted from the desktop, it disappears from view, but the actual contents of `Secret.docx` may still exist in the hard drive's data blocks until new data is written over it. This is why forensic analysts can often recover deleted files using specialized tools  they can scan the raw sectors of a drive for file remnants, even if the system considers them "deleted."

In addition, if the file was recently accessed, parts of it may remain in cache memory (RAM or disk cache), where the system temporarily stored it for faster access. These cached fragments, along with potential thumbnail images (like `thumbs.db` in Windows), can provide valuable evidence even if the main file is gone. **Overwriting** is the process of replacing the data of a deleted file with new information stored in the same physical location on the storage device. When you delete a file, the operating system marks its storage space as "free," but doesn’t actually erase the underlying data. As a result, that space remains recoverable until something new is saved to that exact location.

We can now find our `important.txt` from MFT table using plugin `mftparser`. Its output wil be very long so we need to write in file `mftdata` and it will take long time.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab4.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 mftparser > mftdata 
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6
```

```bash
❯ cat mftdata | grep -i important.txt

```

As we can see it indeed has `Important.txt`.

```bash
❯ cat mftdata | grep -i important.txt -A 30
```

> It will grep `Important.txt` and the matching line along with the next 30 lines after it.

```bash

Combining the recovered fragments yields `[redacted output]`. The unusual format appears to have been chosen to make simple string searches less effective.
# MemLabs Lab 5 - Black Tuesday
## **Challenge Description**

We received this memory dump from our client recently. Someone accessed his system when he was not there and he found some rather strange files being accessed. Find those files and they might be useful. I quote his exact statement,

> The names were not readable. They were composed of alphabets and numbers but I wasn't able to make out what exactly it was.

Also, he noticed his most loved application that he always used crashed every time he ran it. Was it a virus?

**Note-1**: This scenario contains three recovered artifacts. If the second looks final, it is not.

**Note-2**: There was a small mistake when making this challenge. If you find any string which has the string "**_L4B_3_D0n3_!!**" in it, please change it to "**_L4B_5_D0n3_!!**" and then proceed.

**Note-3**: Stage 2 depends on the value recovered in stage 1.

We see two notepad running one uppercase and one lowercase. Lets look at arguments for now using `cmdline`.

```

We see one `notepad.exe` at `C:\Windows\system32\notepad.exe` which is original and another `NOTEPAD.exe` at `C:\Users\SmartNet\Videos\NOTEPAD.EXE` which is weird place for Notepad to be so it is prolly a Malware.

```bash
WinRAR.exe pid:   2924
Command line : "C:\Program Files\WinRAR\WinRAR.exe" "C:\Users\SmartNet\Documents\SW1wb3J0YW50.rar"
```

We also got this `SW1wb3J0YW50.rar` file which we will look into later. First let's look at screenshots and clipboard in dump. Clipboard didn't have anything but we got something good at screenshot.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab5.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 screenshot -D .

If we look at Image `session_1.WinSta0.Default.png`.

![lab_5_1.png](/img/lab_5_1.png)

We can see `base64` encoded text at uppermost left corner. We can write it manually however i will just copy few strings from it and search with strings.

```bash
❯ strings MemoryDump_Lab5.raw | grep ZmxhZ3sh
ZmxhZ3shIV93M0xMX2QwbjNfU3Q0ZzMtMV8wZl9MNEJfNV9EMG4zXyEhfQ.lnk

^C
```

```bash
❯ echo ZmxhZ3shIV93M0xMX2QwbjNfU3Q0ZzMtMV8wZl9MNEJfNV9EMG4zXyEhfQ | base64 -d                    
`[redacted output]`
```

We got the first recovered segment, `[redacted output]`. Now we can dump the `SW1wb3J0YW50.rar` file we found.

```bash

We used the first recovered segment as the password, as instructed in the scenario, and extracted `Stage2.png`.

![lab_5_2.png](/img/lab_5_2.png)

The second recovered segment is `[redacted output]`. It claims the process is complete, but the scenario notes that a third artifact still remains.

Last suspicious thing we have left is that `NOTEPAD.exe` which we can dump and do easy reverse engineering. We have to choose one `Notepad` on Videos directory.

```

We got 3 `.dat`, `.vacb`, `.img` files but we should choose `.dat` like before, rename to `notepad.exe` and analyze it in Cutter, you can choose any other program for it.

![lab_5_3.png](/img/lab_5_3.png)

We can see the secret is laid out character by character, which is why it does not appear cleanly in simple string extraction.

# MemLabs Lab 6 - The Reckoning
## **Challenge Description**

We received this memory dump from the Intelligence Bureau Department. They say this evidence might hold some secrets of the underworld gangster David Benjamin. This memory dump was taken from one of his workers whom the FBI busted earlier this week. Your job is to go through the memory dump and see if you can figure something out. FBI also says that David communicated with his workers via the internet so that might be a good place to start.

**Note**: This scenario contains one secret split into two parts.

The output format for this lab is: `[redacted output]`s0me_l33t_Str1ng

In above description it said he is communicating via internet so those `chrome.exe`, `firefox.exe` might be interesting. Lets find arguments first using `cmdline`.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab6.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 cmdline

This archive is the most interesting file here, so we can identify its memory address and dump it.

```bash

We are in correct path but this is file for `flag2` first we need to find password which will probably we `flag1`.

Since he uses Chrome and Firefox lets view their history.

```bash
❯ volatility --plugins=../volatility-plugins -f MemoryDump_Lab6.raw chromehistory
```

It will be long output so we need to find some links that standout.

```bash

```

We can see this pastebin link which is interesting. If we go to given link we see this:

```
1. https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lptcksPt1l_w7Y29V4o6vkEnHToAPqiCkgNNZfS9rCk/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=hangouts&ust=1566208765722000&usg=AFQjCNHXd6Ck6F22MNQEsxdZo21JayPKug
    

2. But David sent the key in mail.
    

3. The key is... :(

Lets go to this Google Docs Link:

```

If we look first time it will look like lorem ipsum only but if we observe carefully we will find Mega Link:

```
Nam faucibus urna felis, vel dictum libero condimentum nec. Nulla vel elit vitae mauris lobortis lacinia et et diam. Aliquam dui ligula, vulputate eget ultrices et, posuere nec ipsum. Fusce elementum imperdiet enim, nec https://mega.nz/#!SrxQxYTQ molestie ante. In mi metus, sodales eu urna ac, malesuada maximus justo. Fusce auctor malesuada pretium. Proin eget erat lacus. Morbi at orci sed purus consectetur interdum. Nullam lacinia dignissim magna, vitae gravida lorem feugiat et. Etiam tincidunt dui ante, eu semper magna dapibus placerat. Fusce quis porttitor lacus. Nam posuere odio at consectetur congue. Vivamus lobortis ante eget sollicitudin malesuada.
```

If we go to `https://mega.nz/#!SrxQxYTQ`, it asks for decryption key which we don't have. Now we need to find both Mega Decryption key and RAR file password also. 

I checked clipboard it was empty and we can check screenshots.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab6.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 screenshot -D . 
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6

Wrote ./session_1.WinSta0.Default.png
Wrote ./session_1.WinSta0.Disconnect.png
Wrote ./session_1.WinSta0.Winlogon.png
```

We will find information at `session_1.WinSta0.Default.png`.

![lab_6_1.png](/img/lab_6_1.png)

We can see Mega Drive Key but there is no key, We can use strings to search for it now.

```bash
❯ strings MemoryDump_Lab6.raw| grep -i "Mega Drive Key"
```

When we scroll down using that above command we will see this section which give us key `zyWxCjCYYSEMA-hZe552qWVXiPwa5TecODbjnsscMIU`.

![lab_6_2.png](/img/lab_6_2.png)

Now put this key into the Mega link `https://mega.nz/file/SrxQxYTQ`. We see an image named `flag.png`. If we try to open it:

```bash
❯ eog flag_.png
```

We will see an error `missing IHDR`

![lab_6_3.png](/img/lab_6_3.png)

IHDR Part was corrupted if we view in `hexedit` so all we need to do is to change `i (69)` to `I (49)`. We call these things magic bytes or file signatures also.

```bash
❯ hexedit flag_.png  
```

![lab_6_4.png](/img/lab_6_4.png)

As we can see I changed `69` to `49` and saved it. Once viewed again, the image reveals the first segment.

![lab_6_5.png](/img/lab_6_5.png)

The first recovered segment is `[redacted output]`. Now we need to find the second part.

```bash
❯ unrar e flag.rar      

UNRAR 7.00 freeware      Copyright (c) 1993-2024 Alexander Roshal


Extracting from flag.rar

Enter password (will not be echoed) for flag2.png: 
```

I first tried the recovered segment as the archive password, but it was incorrect. The next step is to inspect environment variables with `envars`, since that is one source we had not checked yet.

```bash
❯ /usr/bin/volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab6.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 envars
<SNIP>
2940 chrome.exe           0x0000000000371320 RAR password  easypeasyvirus
<SNIP>
```

We got password `easypeasyvirus`.

```bash
❯ unrar e flag.rar

UNRAR 7.00 freeware      Copyright (c) 1993-2024 Alexander Roshal


Extracting from flag.rar

Enter password (will not be echoed) for flag2.png: easypeasyvirus

Extracting  flag2.png                                               
All OK
```

Now we can view `flag2.png` and recover the final output.

![lab_6_6.png](/img/lab_6_6.png)

The second recovered segment is `aN_Am4zINg_!_i_gU3Ss???_}`. Combining both parts yields `[redacted output]`.
